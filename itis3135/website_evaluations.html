        <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
        
        <p>This page evaluates two websites based on the CRAP design principles: <strong>Contrast</strong>, <strong>Repetition</strong>, <strong>Alignment</strong>, and <strong>Proximity</strong>. These principles, introduced by Robin Williams in "The Non-Designer's Design Book," are fundamental guidelines that enhance visual appeal and user experience.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://www.apple.com" target="_blank">Apple.com</a></h3>
            <p>Apple's website is a prime example of excellent web design, showcasing clean aesthetics, intuitive navigation, and a focus on product presentation. The site demonstrates mastery of design principles through its minimalist approach and attention to detail.</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Apple excels at contrast with their signature white backgrounds, black text, and strategic use of product imagery against clean backgrounds. The contrast between text and background is optimal for readability, and they use color contrast effectively to highlight call-to-action buttons and important information.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> The site maintains consistent typography (San Francisco font family), color schemes, spacing, and layout patterns throughout. Navigation elements, button styles, and content blocks follow the same design language, creating a cohesive brand experience.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Every element is precisely aligned on invisible grid systems. Text blocks, images, and interactive elements are perfectly aligned both horizontally and vertically, creating a sense of order and professionalism that guides the user's eye naturally through the content.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Related elements are grouped together logically. Product information, specifications, and purchase options are placed in close proximity to each other, making it easy for users to understand relationships between different pieces of information.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3><a href="https://www.angelfire.com/super/badwebs/" target="_blank">Angelfire Bad Websites Collection</a></h3>
            <p>This collection of intentionally terrible websites serves as a perfect example of what happens when CRAP principles are completely ignored. These sites demonstrate every possible design mistake, from poor color choices to chaotic layouts.</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> These sites often feature terrible contrast with light text on light backgrounds, or clashing colors that make text unreadable. Some use neon colors on bright backgrounds, creating visual chaos and making content nearly impossible to read.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> There is no consistency in fonts, colors, or layout patterns. Each section might use different fonts, colors, and styles, creating a jarring and unprofessional appearance that confuses users and breaks the visual flow.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Elements are scattered randomly across the page with no apparent grid system or alignment strategy. Text blocks, images, and navigation elements are misaligned, creating a chaotic and unprofessional appearance that makes the content difficult to follow.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Related information is scattered throughout the page with no logical grouping. Important information might be separated by unrelated content, making it difficult for users to understand relationships between different pieces of information.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>CRAP Principles Summary</h3>
            <p>The comparison between Apple's website and the bad websites collection clearly demonstrates the importance of following CRAP principles. Apple's adherence to these principles creates a professional, user-friendly experience, while the bad websites' disregard for these principles results in chaotic, unusable designs. Understanding and applying these principles is essential for creating effective web designs that communicate clearly and provide excellent user experiences.</p>

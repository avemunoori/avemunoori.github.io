        <h2>About Our Digital Scavenging Mission</h2>
        
        <div class="about-content">
            <p>Adamant Vulture's Digital Solutions was born from a simple observation: in the fast-paced world of technology, many businesses are left with outdated systems, unused data, and missed opportunities. Just like vultures in nature clean up and recycle what others leave behind, we saw an opportunity to help businesses make the most of their digital resources.</p>
            
            <p>Our founder, inspired by the persistence and efficiency of vultures, realized that the same principles that make these birds successful in the wild could be applied to digital problem-solving. Vultures are patient, thorough, and never waste an opportunity â€“ exactly the qualities needed in today's competitive tech landscape.</p>
            
            <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
            <p>We believe that every piece of data, every line of code, and every digital asset has potential value. Our "scavenging" approach means we look for hidden gems in your existing systems, identify opportunities others might miss, and transform digital "scraps" into valuable business solutions.</p>
            
            <h3>What Makes Us Different</h3>

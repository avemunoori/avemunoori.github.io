        <p>Welcome to my ITIS 3135 course website! This page serves as the central hub for all my coursework, assignments, and projects related to Web-Based Application Design and Development.</p>
        
        <p>Throughout this course, I'll be learning about modern web development practices, including HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and responsive design principles. This page will be updated regularly as I complete assignments and build new projects.</p>

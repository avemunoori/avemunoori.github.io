        <p>Welcome to my personal website! I'm a passionate computer science student with a diverse range of interests and experiences. When I'm not coding, you'll often find me scaling rock walls or playing piano, as I believe in maintaining a well-rounded lifestyle that balances technical skills with creative and physical pursuits.</p>
        
        <p>My journey in computer science has been enriched by completing two valuable internships that have given me real-world experience in software development and problem-solving. These experiences have deepened my passion for technology and reinforced my commitment to pursuing a career in computer science. I'm particularly interested in exploring areas like software engineering, data structures, and emerging technologies that can make a positive impact on society.</p>

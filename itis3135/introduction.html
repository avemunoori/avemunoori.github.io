        <h3>Personal Background</h3>
        <p>I'm a passionate computer science student with a diverse range of interests and experiences. When I'm not coding, you'll often find me scaling rock walls or playing piano, as I believe in maintaining a well-rounded lifestyle that balances technical skills with creative and physical pursuits. I enjoy the challenge of problem-solving both in programming and in climbing, where each route presents a unique puzzle to solve.</p>
        
        <h3>Professional Background</h3>
        <p>My journey in computer science has been enriched by completing two valuable internships that have given me real-world experience in software development and problem-solving. These experiences have deepened my passion for technology and reinforced my commitment to pursuing a career in computer science. I've worked on various projects involving web development, data analysis, and software engineering, which has given me a solid foundation in both frontend and backend technologies.</p>
        
        <h3>Academic Background</h3>
        <p>I'm currently pursuing my degree in Computer Science at UNC Charlotte, where I've been able to explore various aspects of the field including data structures, algorithms, software engineering, and web development. My coursework has provided me with a strong theoretical foundation while my internships have given me practical experience in applying these concepts to real-world problems.</p>
        
        <h3>Background in this Course</h3>
        <p>This is my first formal course focused specifically on web-based application design and development. While I have some experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from personal projects and internships, I'm excited to learn the proper methodologies, best practices, and modern frameworks that will help me become a more effective web developer. I'm particularly interested in learning about responsive design, accessibility, and the latest web technologies.</p>
        
        <h3>Primary Computer Platform</h3>
        <p>I primarily work on macOS, using a MacBook Pro for development. I'm comfortable with both command-line tools and various IDEs, and I enjoy the flexibility that comes with Unix-based systems for development work.</p>
        
        <h3>Courses I'm Taking</h3>
        <p>This semester, I'm taking ITIS 3135 (Web-Based Application Design and Development), along with other computer science courses that focus on algorithms, data structures, and software engineering principles. I'm also taking some general education courses to round out my academic experience.</p>
        
        <h3>Funny/Interesting Story</h3>
        <p>During one of my internships, I spent an entire day debugging what I thought was a complex algorithm issue, only to discover that the problem was a simple typo in a variable name. The variable was named "userNmae" instead of "userName" - that missing 'a' caused hours of confusion! It was a humbling reminder that sometimes the simplest mistakes can be the most time-consuming to find, and it taught me the importance of careful code review and consistent naming conventions.</p>
        
        <h3>Something Else to Share</h3>
        <p>I'm really excited about the intersection of technology and outdoor activities. I've been working on a personal project to create a web application that helps climbers track their progress and find new routes. It combines my love for coding with my passion for climbing, and I'm hoping to learn new techniques in this course that will help me make it even better!</p>
